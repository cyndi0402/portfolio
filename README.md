### 1. Potato Chips Sales Analytics

**Keywords: Marketing Analytics, Customer Segmentation, Statistical Hypothesis Testing**

**Tools: Python(Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy)**

- Determined potato chips as leisure snacks, increase in sales mainly led by impulse purchase
- Investigated discrepancy in customer purchasing behavior based on age group, family size, and premium level
- Identified Mainstream young singles and couples pay more per packet of chips, more likely to impulse purchase
- Found Mainstream young singles and couples' preferences towards Tyrrells (a brand of potato chips)
- Recommend off-locating Tyrrells and smaller packs of chips in discretionary space near segments where young singles and couples frequent
